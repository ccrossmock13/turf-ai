QUESTION 6:
How do I treat dollar spot on bentgrass?

ANSWER:
To treat dollar spot on bentgrass, the following treatments are recommended based on the documents provided:

1) Trifloxystrobin (Armada, Tartan) and Triadimefon, with a recommended efficacy rating of 3.5, can be applied at 14-28 day intervals. 

2) Thiophanate-methyl at a rate of 4, and applied at 14-day intervals is also effective. 

3) Several studies also suggest the use of paclobutrazol or flurprimidol as these slightly suppress the development of dollar spot. When paclobutrazol is used on creeping bentgrass for growth regulation, fungicide rates can be reduced by 20-25% with no loss in dollar spot control. 

4) The use of monthly applications of ethephon (Proxy) is not recommended as it increases dollar spot pressure. 

Remember, harmful resistance to certain fungicides like SDHI has recently been detected, so it's best to rotate between fungicides from different classes and combine control methods to manage resistance. 

When applying these fungicides, apply them in the early morning or evening, in at least 2 to 5 gallons of water per 1,000 sq ft when the air temperature is above 45°F. Additionally, they should be watered in immediately after application with overhead irrigation. 

Avoid applying during hot weather and periods of severe environmental stress. Do not apply to cool-season turf when daytime air temperatures exceed 85°F. Also, always check the pH of the water you're using to mix these fungicides, and make sure it's between 4.0 and 7.0. If it's not, include a buffering agent. Lastly, ensure thorough and complete spray coverage using appropriate nozzle/gallonage (carrier volume) combinations.

QUESTION 8:
What causes fairy ring and how do I fix it?

ANSWER:
Fairy rings are caused by a group of fungi that decompose organic matter in the soil. This can cause the development of dense circles of lush, dark-colored grass or dead, brown patches, often affiliated with the presence of mushrooms or puffballs.

Fairy rings can be managed with the help of a proper fungicide program that includes the use of specific fungicides and soil surfactant applications. One such program is applying Posterity XT fungicide at a rate of 3.0 fl oz per 1000 ft² when soil temperatures reach 55°F to 60°F, followed by immediate irrigation. This treatment should be repeated after 28 days. Additionally, applications of Briskway and Velista fungicides can be used at a rate of 0.7 fl oz per 1000 ft² on a 28-day cycle as well. Remember to water-in immediately after each application. 

Depth of the infestation must also be determined to decide the amount of irrigation needed: if the fairy ring is limited to the thatch layer, 0.15 inches of irrigation is needed, while if the ring is 2-3 inches deep in the soil, 0.25 inches of irrigation is required. 

It's important to note that this is just a guiding program. Environmental conditions, state laws, and the specific products registered for use in your area may require adjustments to this program. Always consult product labels and local extension services for complete use and application information.

QUESTION 9:
Brown patch treatment for tall fescue?

ANSWER:
Brown patch on tall fescue can be effectively managed with a combination of proper cultural practices and fungicide applications. 

Cultural practices include maintaining appropriate irrigation timing and avoiding the return of grass clippings, which can act as a source of inoculum for brown patch development. 

In terms of chemical control, several fungicides are known to be effective against brown patch. For example, the combination of azoxystrobin and propiconazole (Posterity Forte) can be applied every 14-21 days. Pyraclostrobin with fluxapyroxad (Lexicon Intrinsic) is another mix that can be applied at a 14-28 day interval. 

Applications of these fungicides should be made on a preventative basis when soil temperatures at a two-inch depth are between 65-70°F. In order to improve fungicide absorption, applying 1/8” to 1/4” of irrigation directly after spraying is recommended. 

However, the ideal approach would depend on local environmental conditions and lawn health status, which aren't specified in the context. Also, remember to always follow product labels for exact rates and timings.

QUESTION 13:
Greens have dry spots after irrigation, what to check?

ANSWER:
Dry spots on greens after irrigation might be due to several issues. You should check the following:

1. Irrigation System Uniformity: Dry spots may be an indication of poor distribution uniformity (DU) within the irrigation system. You should carry out an irrigation audit to monitor the system's efficiency and identify if any areas are being under-irrigated. 

2. Sprinkler Head Spacing: Spacing greatly affects DU. Irrigation heads should ideally be arranged in a triangular pattern for better water distribution.

3. Localized Dry Spots (LDS): These may be caused by soil-water repellency, and may require the application of wetting agents to improve soil moisture uniformity.

4. Soil Water Content: Check this using soil water content meters. Regular measurements can help identify any discrepancies between different areas of the green.

5. Water Pressure: Low pressure can lead to inadequate water distribution, check for inconsistencies or drops in water pressure.

6. Sprinkler Head Issues: Check if the sprinkler heads are worn out, clogged, or broken. These issues can greatly affect the sprinkler's coverage.

7. Elevation Factor: The elevation of your golf course can affect the sprinkler heads' effective throw distance. Depending on the location and atmospheric pressure, this may differ from manufacturers' specifications.

If the problem persists despite these checks and adjustments, you may need to consult with an expert turfgrass agronomist for further evaluation and recommendations.

QUESTION 31:
Summer stress management for bentgrass?

ANSWER:
During summer stress periods, various practices to manage bentgrass include:

1. Rolling: Under stressful conditions, offset slower green speeds caused by reduced mowing frequency or increased cut height by rolling greens with lightweight rollers up to three times a week. This also helps reduce diseases like anthracnose and dollar spot by increasing leaf mass. 

2. Irrigation & drainage: Avoid root-zone saturation. Proper irrigation and drainage improve soil oxygen levels and reduce heat conduction into the root zone. Use moisture sensing sensors to detect dry soil conditions to prevent drought stress. Use wetting agents when hand watering dry spots.

3. Limit leaf wetness: Minimize leaf wetness caused by dew. Mowing or dew whipping during early morning hours can be beneficial.

4. Vent the greens: Use non-disruptive cultivation methods like using needle tines or spiking to create small holes that allow gas exchange, encourage evaporation of excess soil moisture.

5. Fertilization: Use foliar applications of soluble nitrogen at rates of 0.125-0.25 lb N/1,000 sq ft every 10-14 days. Avoid high fertility rates in summer as this can enhance disease activity. 

6. Top dressing: Continue topdressing but at a light rate to match the growth of the grass. 

7. Adjust mowing: Mow every third or fourth day or more if the green is stressed and not growing rapidly. Use lightweight walk-behind mowers on stressed greens, if possible.

Remember that these practices should be adapted based on the specific conditions of your golf course or lawn, including climate, soil type, and level of stress on the grass.

QUESTION 34:
Heat stress symptoms and treatment?

ANSWER:
Heat stress in turfgrass can manifest in a variety of symptoms such as slowed or halted growth, wilting, discoloration, and increased susceptibility to diseases like anthracnose and dollar spot. Under extreme heat conditions, the turf may go dormant, with reduced photosynthesis and root growth. 

The treatment and management of heat stress in turfgrass include various practices:

1. **Mowing**: Reduce mowing frequency or raise the height of the cut. Skip mowing every third or fourth day if the turf is stressed. Use lightweight walk-behind mowers, preferably on stressed greens, to reduce damage, and maintain sharp blades for a clean cut.

2. **Rolling**: Use lightweight rollers to offset the effects of reduced mowing frequency or increased cut height. This practice helps maintain green speed and helps the turf increase its leaf mass, promoting photosynthesis.

3. **Irrigation and Drainage**: Avoid root-zone saturation. Use hand watering methods to avoid overwatering, aim to target known dry spots, and elevated areas. Consider using wetting agents for more efficient moisture retention. 

4. **Aeration**: Vent the greens via needle tines, spiking, or other means to improve root-zone aeration and cooling. Do this at three-week intervals beginning in early summer.

5. **Fertilization**: Use foliar applications of soluble nitrogen at rates of 0.125-0.25 lb N/1,000 sq ft every 10-14 days. Avoid high rates during summer as this can encourage disease activity.

6. **Syringing**: On hot days, reduce heat stress by syringing during the afternoon. Apply water only to the foliage and avoid saturating the root zone.

7. **Pruning**: Where air circulation and cooling are inadequate, prune or remove trees and underbrush or install fans. 

As per the product label of Interface Stressgard, applying fungicides like Densicor or Mirage Stressgard that offer control of anthracnose and summer patch could also be relevant.

These measures should help to manage heat stress effectively and maintain the turf in healthy condition, promoting better growth, resilience, and visual appeal of the turfgrass.

QUESTION 35:
Winter desiccation prevention?

ANSWER:
Using covers can help prevent winter desiccation on the turf. These covers protect the grass from extreme cold and wind damage, which could cause drying out. According to superintendent Szablewski from Kansas, he only uses covers in areas that have had previous issues with winter damage.

Furthermore, monitoring the turf's moisture levels is crucial. Superintendent Szablewski mentions that keeping proper moisture in the plant and subsurface when the ground freezes is an effective way to prevent winter injury and desiccation. However, further details on specific rates, timing, and products are not provided in the documents.

Also, it's essential to choose the right types of grass, as some are more resistant to cold weather. Bremer emphasizes that "The proper species of turf is the best place to start." For instance, according to several superintendents, the bent grass is known to handle cold weather well.

Lastly, the application of regular tops dressing can help protect the crowns and also keep the thatch layer under control to avoid plant desiccation.

QUESTION 36:
Grub control timing and products?

ANSWER:
Grub control is typically targeted before the historical peak of adult flight of the species being targeted, up to 45 days prior to the peak. Products used for control commonly include thiamethoxam and chlorantraniliprole. Application rates may vary from 16 - 20 fl oz per acre (0.208-0.260 lb thiamethoxam and 0.104-0.130 lb chlorantraniliprole) or 3.7 - 4.6 fl oz per 10,000 sq ft (0.048-0.060 lb thiamethoxam and 0.024-0.030 lb chlorantraniliprole), applying from egg hatch to second instar (when grubs are less than half their full size). 

In more precise treatment, applications can be timed to occur from peak adult flight to peak egg hatch for optimal control. If the grubs started infesting turfgrass, applications of A15452 from early April to early September are recommended for preventative and early remedial control. 

For beetle species such as the black turfgrass Ataenius larvae, applications should be done before the eggs of the first-generation hatch, typically during May. 

After application of the product, sufficient water is needed to cover the area uniformly. If sufficient rainfall (1/4-1/2 inch of water) does not occur, then irrigation should occur within 24 hours.

Note: Always consult the product label for complete application information as the specific details may vary by product.

To treat armyworms, you can use a product containing 0.052 – 0.26 lb thiamethoxam and 0.026 – 0.13 lb chlorantraniliprole per acre, or 0.013 – 0.06 lb thiamethoxam and 0.0065 – 0.03 lb chlorantraniliprole per 10,000 sq ft. The product should be applied when populations are first observed. If the area being treated is maintained at a mowing height of greater than one inch, then use the higher rates within the rate range to control heavy pressure. Delay watering (irigation) or mowing for 24 hours after application to ensure optimum control.

QUESTION 38:
Annual bluegrass weevil management?

ANSWER:
For Annual Bluegrass Weevil (ABW) management, apply A15452 when overwintered adult weevils are observed in late April or early May. This is to prevent damage from the first generation larvae in late-May and June. Use rates of 10 – 20 fl oz per acre or 2.3 – 4.6 fl oz per 10,000 sq ft. If there is heavy ABW pressure after mid-May, make sure to use the higher rates within this range for control.

Insecticides should be applied once turfgrass quality becomes unacceptable, which is determined by visual evaluations. Regarding biological control, research has also shown that the Annual Bluegrass Weevil itself can act as a biological control for Annual Bluegrass in creeping bentgrass fairways under certain conditions.

QUESTION 39:
Chinch bug identification and control?

ANSWER:
Chinch bugs are small, black and white insects that can cause significant damage to turfgrass. They are identified by their shiny black bodies and white wings. 

To control chinch bugs, apply A15452 at a rate of 10 - 20 fl oz per acre or 2.3 - 4.6 fl oz per 10,000 sq ft. This provides the needed amounts of 0.13 - 0.26 lb thiamethoxam and 0.065 - 0.13 lb chlorantraniliprole per acre, or 0.03 - 0.06 lb thiamethoxam and 0.015 - 0.03 lb chlorantraniliprole per 10,000 sq ft for optimum control. Apply when young nymphs are first observed.

After application, be sure to irrigate within 24 hours if sufficient rainfall (1/4-1/2 inch of water) hasn't occurred. This product should be applied using a broadcast spray, making sure to use a sufficient volume of water to cover the area being treated uniformly. If the context lacks specific identification characters for the chinch bugs, this guideline may not apply. Always wear protective clothing and use suitable devices during the application process. Avoid contact with granules and breathing dust. 

Please recall not to allow worker entry into treated regions during the restricted space interval (REI) of 24 hours. Also, note the storage and disposal guidelines stated in the label.

QUESTION 40:
Mole cricket control in bermudagrass?

ANSWER:
For controlling mole crickets in bermudagrass, you can use the product Chipco Choice. The product should be applied using either slit-placement application equipment or broadcast application equipment. The recommended rate for application is between 12.5 to 25 pounds per acre or between 4.6 to 9.4 ounces per 1000 square feet. Apply the product from mid-summer to control 3rd and 4th instar larvae which is usually the peak egg hatch period. After application, irrigation or rainfall of about 1/4-1/2 inch is recommended within 24 hours if it doesn't occur naturally. This helps to bring the product into contact with the granules in the soil for effective control of mole crickets. Note that this product is not fit for use for human or animal consumption and improper disposal can lead to violations of federal law. It should hence be stored properly, away from the reach of children or animals. Remember to always wear protective clothing and use appropriate equipment during application and to avoid contact with granules and breathing dust. For enhanced activity, this product can be used alongside another insecticide such as lambda-cyhalothrin. Consult the label of the other insecticide for use instructions and site applicability.

QUESTION 41:
How to improve soil drainage on greens?

ANSWER:
To improve soil drainage on greens, it is recommended to perform a thorough site analysis and install drainage if necessary before a problem occurs. The following key elements should be included as part of a successful drainage master plan:
1. A map of existing drain lines that identifies their age and performance.
2. The locations of wet areas.
3. The locations of surface collection areas.
4. Notes identifying where seepage drains might be needed.
5. Pipe sizing and drainage design for any necessary improvements.
6. Labor and cost estimates for improving drainage.

Improved soil drainage will result in the quick and effective removal of excess water from playing surfaces, improving turf health and allowing play to quickly resume following rain events. The focus of drainage projects should be on high-profile areas such as greens, fairway landing zones, and high-traffic areas.

QUESTION 42:
Soil test interpretation for pH?

ANSWER:
The soil test showed slightly-acidic pH. This is within the acceptable range for a mature creeping bentgrass fairway system. Therefore, no amendments to correct pH were necessary. The liming agent treatments significantly increased pH in the 0 to 5 cm soil depth relative to the untreated control plots. There was no significant difference in mean soil pH observed between the three liming agent treatments. Soil pH levels decreased with sample depth regardless of the topdressing treatment.

QUESTION 43:
Compaction relief methods?

ANSWER:
The context doesn't provide specific information about compaction relief methods for turfgrass. However, generally, compaction can be relieved through methods such as core aeration, solid tine aeration, and deep drilling. These methods involve mechanically removing soil plugs or creating holes in the soil to reduce soil compaction, allowing water, air, and nutrients to move more freely and promote root growth. The chosen method can depend on the level of compaction, grass species, soil type, and specific site conditions. Further recommendations would require more specific information about the site and turfgrass conditions.
