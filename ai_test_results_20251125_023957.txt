QUESTION 11:
Rain Bird 5004 rotor pops up but won't retract, is it the wiper seal or spring?

ANSWER:
To address the issue of a Rain Bird 5004 rotor not retracting, the likely culprit could be the wiper seal. The wiper seal is responsible for sealing the riser to prevent water from leaking out and also helps in the retraction of the rotor after operation. If the wiper seal is damaged or worn out, it can cause the rotor not to retract properly.

To resolve this issue, you can replace the wiper seal in the Rain Bird 5004 rotor. You can refer to the Rain Bird Golf Catalog 2023 for specific replacement parts and instructions on how to replace the wiper seal. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for proper installation.

If replacing the wiper seal does not solve the issue, then you may need to check the spring inside the rotor. The spring helps in retracting the rotor after operation. If the spring is damaged or broken, it can also cause the rotor not to retract properly.

Inspect the spring for any signs of damage or wear. If the spring is indeed the issue, you may need to replace it with a new one. Again, refer to the Rain Bird Golf Catalog 2023 for specific replacement parts and instructions on how to replace the spring.

By addressing either the wiper seal or the spring, you should be able to fix the problem of the Rain Bird 5004 rotor not retracting properly.

QUESTION 13:
Fairway 12 has dry spots on north end only, controller shows full cycle time - what to check?

ANSWER:
To address the dry spots on the north end of Fairway 12 where the controller shows a full cycle time, you should check the irrigation system for potential issues. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Perform a Turf Stress Test**: As mentioned in the document, conducting a stress test can help uncover areas of turf that aren't receiving proper irrigation. This test involves deficit-irrigating at 50% of the previous day’s evapotranspiration (ET) and applying supplemental water by hand only two days per week (Tuesday and Friday). This will help identify any weaknesses in the irrigation system.

2. **Check Irrigation Patterns**: Look for any irregularities or inconsistencies in the irrigation patterns on Fairway 12. The stress test may reveal if the north end is not receiving adequate water compared to other areas.

3. **Inspect Sprinkler Heads**: Check the sprinkler heads on the north end of Fairway 12 to ensure they are functioning correctly. Clean or replace any clogged or malfunctioning heads.

4. **Check Water Pressure**: Verify that the water pressure is consistent throughout the irrigation system. Low pressure can lead to dry spots.

5. **Inspect for Leaks**: Look for any leaks in the irrigation pipes or connections that could be affecting water distribution to the north end of Fairway 12.

6. **Adjust Controller Settings**: If the controller shows a full cycle time, review and adjust the programming to ensure that the north end of Fairway

QUESTION 15:
Hunter ICV valve sticking open intermittently, solenoid or diaphragm problem?

ANSWER:
To address the issue of a Hunter ICV valve sticking open intermittently, the problem is likely related to the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a common component that can cause valves to stick open if it is damaged or worn out. 

To resolve this issue, you should replace the diaphragm in the Hunter ICV valve. You can use the Hunter Industries Replacement Diaphragm Kit specifically designed for the ICV series valves. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper installation.

QUESTION 35:
Exposed greens getting winter desiccation, should I cover them or apply an anti-transpirant?

ANSWER:
For exposed greens experiencing winter desiccation, it would be beneficial to cover them rather than applying an anti-transpirant based on the provided context.

QUESTION 42:
Soil test shows pH 5.2 on bentgrass greens, how much lime per 1000 sq ft to raise to 6.5?

ANSWER:
To raise the pH from 5.2 to 6.5 on bentgrass greens, you can use dolomitic limestone. Dolomitic limestone typically raises the pH and provides magnesium to the soil. 

To calculate the amount of dolomitic limestone needed per 1000 sq ft:

1. Determine the current pH adjustment needed: 6.5 (desired pH) - 5.2 (current pH) = 1.3 pH units to raise.
2. Refer to the limestone recommendation: Typically, 50-100 pounds of dolomitic limestone per 1,000 square feet is needed to raise the pH by 1.0 unit.
3. Calculate the amount needed: If 50 pounds raises the pH by 1 unit, then for 1.3 units, you would need approximately 65 pounds per 1,000 sq ft.

Apply the calculated amount of dolomitic limestone evenly over the bentgrass greens and water it in well to help it incorporate into the soil.

QUESTION 47:
Transitioning from summer to fall on bentgrass, when to increase nitrogen applications?

ANSWER:
Transitioning from summer to fall on bentgrass, you should increase nitrogen applications in late-fall. Research by Erdahl in 1989 showed that an average of 56 kg N ha-1 was applied to Wisconsin putting greens in October and November. This accounted for 47% of the mean annual N budget. Therefore, increasing nitrogen applications during this period would be beneficial for bentgrass transitioning from summer to fall. Use a suitable nitrogen fertilizer product at the recommended rate based on your specific turfgrass needs.

QUESTION 48:
Covering greens for winter protection in USDA zone 6, plastic or permeable covers?

ANSWER:
Based on the provided context, for winter protection of greens in USDA zone 6, using a combination of plastic and permeable covers is recommended. The order of covering system mentioned in the document from Stephens in Alaska includes a permeable grow cover first, followed by a resin-coated polymer similar to EnkaMat. The permeable grow cover allows for heat and stimulated spring green-up, while the resin-coated polymer helps hold up the snow layer and allows for forced air flow and gas exchange. 

Therefore, for winter protection in USDA zone 6, you can follow a similar system by using a permeable grow cover first and then a resin-coated polymer like EnkaMat to protect the greens effectively.
