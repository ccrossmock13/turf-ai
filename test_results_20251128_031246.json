This allows for weed control without damaging the turf. [Source 3]\n\n2. **Full Renovation/Kill Situations**: Use glyphosate to completely kill existing vegetation when planning to renovate or re-seed the lawn. This ensures a clean slate for new turf establishment. [Source 3]\n\n3. **Isolated Spot Treatment**: Use extreme caution when applying glyphosate to small, isolated areas to target specific weeds without affecting the surrounding turf. Ensure no drift or overspray occurs. [Source 3]\n\nFor general weed control in an active lawn, consider selective herbicides that target specific weeds without harming the turfgrass. Always verify the herbicide's selectivity for your turf type and follow label instructions.",
